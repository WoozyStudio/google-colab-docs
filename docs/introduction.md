Welcome to the introduction of this documentation, first we are going to know a little bit about the Google Colab interface and then some basics of Python and Jupiter Notebook.

## Steps

Step 1. The first thing we are going to do is to enter https://colab.google and click on New Notebook.

Step 2. Once we have entered our Jupiter Notebook environment, it will generate a code box. This is where we will write our Python code.

Step 3. Copy this code below and see what happens. Don't worry, you don't have to understand it for now, you will know what it means later.

```python
print("Welcome to Google Colab!")
```

Already in Colab you should see something like this.
